## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The image conversion process is handled entirely on the client-side using the HTML5 Canvas API.

1.  When an image is uploaded, it's loaded into an in-memory canvas element.
2.  The canvas content is then exported to a data blob with the selected format (`image/webp`, `image/jpeg`, etc.) and quality level.
3.  This blob is used to create an object URL, which is then displayed as a preview and used for downloads.
4.  This approach ensures that your private images are never sent over the network, providing maximum privacy and security.
